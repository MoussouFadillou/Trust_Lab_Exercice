Gaol and approach:
For the task of this exercice the goal was to find pages from the common crawl archive that discuss or are relevant to COVID-19â€™s economic impact. My approach was to use python and some packages like beautifulsoup and comcrawl. For comcrawl, it is a python package for easily querying and downloading pages from commoncrawl.org. Inside this comcrawl package i use the function IndexClient for indexing each month in 2020 which i get in the Data location link.
